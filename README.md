# PVCALC
PVCALC is a module for calculating PV from MITgcm output, building on the xarray framework. It features a series of sub-modules containing useful functions for calculating PV and two scripts: one for calculating the PV of a model level and another for slices along bands of constant latitude. The scripts can be launced from the command line with most parameters set by flags. The scripts will only work on files generated by the mnc module. See the sample `data.mnc` file.
